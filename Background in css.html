  <h1>Sidra's Creation</h1>
  <p>A good introduction should identify your topic, provide essential context, and 
  indicate your particular focus in the essay. It also needs to engage your readers' 
  interest. ... Since no two essays are the same, no single formula will automatically
   generate an introduction and conclusion for you.</p>
  <p>The definition of introduction is making something known for the first time, 
  or formally telling two people who the other person is. An example of introduction
 is when you create a new product and tell customers about it in a commercial.</p>
